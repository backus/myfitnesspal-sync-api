MyFitnessPal Sync API
=====================

This library implements parts of the [MyFitnessPal](http://www.myfitnesspal.com/) iPhone sync API. This is still a work in progress and currently only implements serialization and deserialization.

* Thanks to [Nathan Reynolds](https://github.com/nathforge) for his work on the much more thorough python implementation [myfitnesspal-sync](https://github.com/nathforge/myfitnesspal-sync). I ended up going with a different design internally but I originally considered this a ruby port of his work.
